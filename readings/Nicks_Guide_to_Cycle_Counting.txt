Nick Bensema's Guide to Cycle Counting on the Atari 2600
version 0.5a, 7/17/96

1. INTRODUCTION

Cycle counting is an important aspect of Atari 2600 programming.
It makes possible the positioning of sprites, the drawing of six-digit 
scores, non-mirrored playfield graphics and many other cool TIA tricks 
that keep every game from looking like Combat.  In fact, even Combat
makes use of some cycle counting to position the tanks and to draw the 
scores into the playfield, though its methods aren't quite as precise as 
your typical Activision game.

Cycle counting's uses don't end at silly screen hacks.  It is also useful 
for optimizing code to fit within a vertical blank, or a scanline, or a
horizontal blank.

2. CONCEPTS OF COUNTING

Programming the Atari requires one to modify one's perceptions of space and 
time, because the Atari observes some sort of Abian physics where space 
is time.  One frame is 1/60 of a second.  One scanline is 1/20000 of a 
second.  You get the idea.  It is important to know how much code can
be executed in the amount of time it takes to draw the screen.  The unit
of time we use is cycles.

2.1. CPU CYCLES IN RELATION TO SCREEN PIXELS

The CPU clock works at a somewhat slow pace compared to the TIA.  The TIA 
draws three pixels in the time it takes to execute one CPU cycle.  A WSYNC 
command will halt the processor until the horizontal blank, which lasts 
about 20 CPU cycles, after which the electron beam turns on and begins to 
draw the picture once again.  Therefore the X position of the electron
beam is determined like this:

  X = (CYCLES - 20) * 3

where CYCLES is the number of cycles that have elapsed since the horizontal 
blank.  But the text I have states that registers are only read every five 
cycles, so the equation must be adjusted to account for that.  For now, 
let's just assume that we round up to the next multiple of 15.  The examples
we use will involve RESP0, because I know the rule applies to that register.

If X is a negative number, a RESP0 will put player 0 on the left
edge of the screen.

Let's look at a sample nonsense routine.

BEGIN:  STA WSYNC   ;I begin counting here.
        NOP             ; 0 +2 = [2]     (Weenie instruction)
        LDA #0          ; 2 +3 = [5]     (Fast math, immediate)
        STA $FFFF       ; 5 +4 = [9]     (Storage, absolute)
        ROL $FFFE,X     ; 9 +7 = [16]    (Slow math, Absolute,X)
        ROL A           ; 16+2 = [18]    (Slow math, accumulator)
        STA RESP0       ; 18+3 = *21*    (Storage, zero page)
        DEY             ; 21+2 = [23]    (Weenie)
        BNE BEGIN       ; 23+3 = [26]    (Branch)

The number on the left is the number of cycles that have elapsed since
WSYNC at the beginning of each instruction, it is only there to illustrate
the addition of cycles.  The number in brackets is the number of cycles
that have elapsed at the end of each instruction.  It is better to keep
track of this number because writes to TIA registers occur on this cycle.

Note the number 22 next to RESP0 is in asterisks, signifying a write to
a TIA register. (22-20)*3 == 6, and since it is RESP0 we round up to 15
and that is where Player 0 goes.

The cycle count is especially important to RESP0, but almost all writes to 
TIA registers are affected in some way by the cycle count.  A player or 
missile modification too late in the scanline will cause the player to shift 
up one scanline as it moves away from the left side of the screen.  Writes 
to the playfield must be timed to occur in the center of the screen if one 
wishes to produce an asymmetrical playfield.  The number between these 
asterisks is very important to the program, and you may find yourself 
spending hours getting that number to be just what you need it to be for 
your particular application.

I usually put relevant comment outside the counting column, but this isn't 
relevant code so I decided to illustrate the mnemonic device I used to 
determine the cycles for each instruction.

3. HOW TO REMEMBER WHAT TAKES HOW LONG

One cannot be expected to look at a table for every instruction they
use, lest they go mad.  Many instructions, however, have similar
characteristics, and so general rules can be followed in order to
estimate the time of each instruction.

3.1. BRANCHING INSTRUCTIONS

Branching instructions like BNE and BCC are easier than they seem.
All branch instructions take two cycles, plus one extra cycle if
the branch is taken, plus another extra cycle if said branch crosses
the page boundary.

When writing time-sensitive code, I recommend that branch instructions only 
be used at or near the end of a loop that begins in STA WSYNC, or in tight 
loops that are designed to waste a certain number of cycles.  DEY-BNE loops,
which are a common way of accomplishing this, will be covered later.

Let's just say for now that the decision of whether to branch should be 
generally constant throughout at least the time-sensitive portions of your 
routine.  

3.2. FAST MATH INSTRUCTIONS

The 6502 has a family of "fast math" opcodes that have similar 
characteristics, and consequently they have the same cycle counts.  These 
fast math opcodes do little more than alter registers or flags using bits 
from memory.  This family consists of ADC, AND, BIT, CMP, CPX, CPY, EOR, 
LDA, LDX, LDY, ORA, and SBC.  Not all of these instructions have all of
the following address modes, but these rules apply to whichever modes
are available.  I will use ADC as an example.

        ADC #$01        ; +2    Immediate
        ADC $99         ; +3    Zero Page
        ADC $99,X       ; +4    Zero Page,X  (or ,Y)
        ADC $1234       ; +4    Absolute
        ADC $1234,X     ; +4*   Absolute,X  (or ,Y)
        ADC ($AA,X)     ; +6    (Indirect,X)
        ADC ($CC),Y     ; +5*   (Indirect),Y

The asterisk (*) signifies that if the instruction indexes across a
page boundary, add one cycle.  In some cases, just one cycle might not
matter.  

Also note that Zero Page,Y addressing is only available for LDX and STX.

3.3. STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS

The instructions STA, STX, and STY have the same timing as fast math
instructions, but in the case of Absolute,XY and (Indirect),Y addressing,
the extra cycle is always added.

3.4. WEENIE INSTRUCTIONS

These weenie instructions don't even alter memory, only registers and flags.
They are CLC, CLD, CLI, CLV, DEX, DEY, INX, INY, NOP, SEC, SED, SEI, TAX, 
TAY, TSX, TXA, TXS, and TYA.  They take two cycles.  

3.5. SLOW MATH INSTRUCTIONS

There are certain instructions that take more clock cycles than simple math 
instructions.  Some of these instructions can work with the accumulator, but
when given an address to work with, they modify memory directly.  The slow 
math instructions are ASL, DEC, INC, LSR, ROL, and ROR.

        ROR A           ; +2  Accumulator
        ROR $99         ; +5  Zero Page
        ROR $99,X       ; +6  Zero Page,X
        ROR $1234       ; +6  Absolute
        ROR $1234,X     ; +7  Absolute,X

Note that when these instructions work with the accumulator, they shrink down
to two cycles and become Weenie Instructions.

3.6. STACK INSTRUCTIONS

The two push instructions, PHA and PHP, each take three cycles.
The two pull instructions, PLA and PLP, each take four cycles.

3.7. OTHER INSTRUCTIONS
a.k.a INSTRUCTIONS YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS USING IN TIME-SENSITIVE CODE

JSR takes 6 cycles.  JMP takes 3 cycles in absolute mode, and 5 cycles
in absolute indirect mode, but absolute indirect mode is for machines
that have a kernel.  RTI and RTS take 6 cycles each.  But with only a
few dozen instructions available per scanline, you don't have time to
bounce all over the cartridge executing subroutines.

4. CYCLE COUNTING IN PRACTICE

4.1. MULTIPLE POSSIBILITIES

This is how I would handle wishy-washy code that uses a branch.

BEGIN   STA WSYNC       ;CYCLES...
        NOP             ; [0]   +2
        BIT $CC         ; [2]   +3
        BMI STUPID      ; [5]   +2 if not taken...
        NOP             ; [7]   +2   Pretend everything's
        NOP             ; [9]   +2   just smurfy, until...
        NOP             ; [11]  +2
	NOP             ; [13]
	NOP             ; [15]
	NOP		; [17]
        NOP             ; [19]  +2  IF BRANCHED
STUPID  LDA $F0         ; [21]  +3   [8]  (BMI takes +3 now)
        STA GRP0        ; *24*  +3   *11*
        LDA $F1         ; [27]  +3   [14]
        STA ENAM0       ; *30*  +3   *17*
        STA RESP0       ; *33*  +3   *20*
        STA WSYNC

I have to count both possibilities, side by side.  Perhaps there is a
shorter way to do this, but this way if I have to keep track of a long
list, I won't have to page up in the code to figure out what the
difference is.
 
If you can guess what this code does, congratulations.  If you can't,
I'll tell you.  This code checks bit 8 of location $CC.  If it is set,
it goes immediately to set player 0's registers, setting its position
at cycle 20.  If it is clear, then the branch isn't taken so that saves
us one cycle, but fourteen more cycles are taken by NOPs, making a net
gain of 13 cycles.  Now it takes 33 cycles to reset player 0.
        
4.2. HOW TO TAME THE MIGHTY (INDIRECT),Y

Recall that if an (Indirect),Y instruction indexes across a page
boundary, the CPU takes an extra cycle. This means that depending
on the value of Y, the instruction might take four or five cycles.

In six-column or other high resolution display routines, as many
as six (Indirect),Y instructions appear in one scanline.  This adds
up to six extra cycles that may or may not be taken.  This could
throw off your timing unless your data is properly arranged.

Make sure when putting graphics into your program, to arrange the data so
that they either NEVER cross page boundaries, or ALWAYS cross page 
boundaries.  As long as you can predict when that extra cycle is going to
pop up, you'll be OK.  You might need to play around with the assembler
and the source code to make sure all the bytes in each graphics table
are in the same page of memory.

In contrast, one could conceivably use either (Indirect),Y 
or Absolute,XY addressing as part of some sick, twisted timing loop with 
single-cycle precision, but most TIA applications only have a need for 
three-cycle precision.

4.3. THE DEY-BNE LOOP AND ITS APPLICATIONS

The DEY-BNE loop is a useful delay loop.  How useful, I won't know until
I see it applied where Y equals a variable.  I did see it applied to a
constant in this code from Defender:

       STA    WSYNC   ;               Cycle count:
       STA    PF2     ;Clear PF2       [0]  +3
       LDA    $EA     ;                [3]  +3
       STA    COLUP0  ;                [6]  +3
       STA    COLUP1  ;                [9]  +3
       LDY    #$08    ;                [12] +2   Y is set here
       STA    RESP0   ;                *14* +3
LF867: DEY            ;When 8 (17), when 0 (52)  }
       BNE    LF867   ;At end of loop, (54)      } +39
       STA    RESP1   ;                *56* +3
        ; End result: players are 42 CPU cycles apart.

RESP0 occurs at 14 cycles, which is still within the horizontal blank,
so player 0 appears at the left side of the screen.  RESP1 occurs at 56
cycles, and (56-20)*3 = 108 pixels.  Stella.txt says I'm supposed to
round that up to a multiple of 15, so that's.... 120.  If player 1 is
in triple repeat mode, that would put it on the right edge of the screen.
And since this is the routine that sets the TIA up to display the number of 
remaining lives and smart bombs in Defender, that's a distinct possibility.

You can see how I came to the above conclusion if we unroll the loop.

LF867: DEY           ; Y becomes 7          +2 }
       BNE    LF867  ; Branch is taken.     +3 } 5
LF867: DEY           ; Y becomes 6          +2
       BNE    LF867  ; Branch is taken.     +3 } 5
LF867: DEY           ; Y becomes 5          +2
       BNE    LF867  ; Branch is taken.     +3 } 5
LF867: DEY           ; Y becomes 4          +2
       BNE    LF867  ; Branch is taken.     +3 } 5
LF867: DEY           ; Y becomes 3          +2
       BNE    LF867  ; Branch is taken.     +3 } 5
LF867: DEY           ; Y becomes 2          +2
       BNE    LF867  ; Branch is taken.     +3 } 5
LF867: DEY           ; Y becomes 1          +2
       BNE    LF867  ; Branch is taken.     +3 } 5
LF867: DEY           ; Y becomes 0          +2
       BNE    LF867  ; Branch is NOT taken. +2 } 4

Each time through the loop where Y>0, DEY takes two cycles and BNE takes
three cycles (due to the branch).  The last time through the loop, when
Y=0, the branch is not taken so the BNE only takes two cycles.

From this, we can build a model for the DEY-BNE loop.

       LDY #NUM ; +2
        ; extra code possible here
DEYBNE DEY        ; }
       BNE DEYBNE ; } + NUM*5-1

Note that each iteration takes 5 CPU cycles, or 15 pixels.  This is as close
as it gets to perfect for our needs, since the TIA will only let you set up
a player with RESP0 on a multiple of 15.  

The X register can also be used to this end, but hey, it needs a name,
doesn't it?

CONCLUSION

Keep your code clean and tight.  Make sure your display kernel routines use
the same number of scanlines no matter what happens.
